      <div class="content">
        <p>Yards has been brewing Philly's beer since 1994. We’ve grown from a garage-sized operation in Manayunk all the way up to our current location at 500 Spring Garden Street in Northern Liberties. And we couldn't have done it without your support through the years. Our beers always have and always will be brewed, bottled, kegged, and canned for the hard working people of Philadelphia and beyond.</p>
        <p>You can FIND YARDS throughout the Mid-Atlantic Region in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Or you can visit our TAPROOM to go on a BREWERY TOUR and try specialty beers only available at Yards. PHILADELPHIA PALE ALE and BRAWLER, both nationally recognized ales, lead our balanced portfolio of quality, handcrafted beers including nine year-round offerings and several seasonal and limited releases.</p>

          <p class="subtitle">IPA 6.5% ABV</p>
          <p class="subsubtitle">People in Philly don't have a filter, and neither does our Philthy Hazy IPA. This bold, aromatic ale is loaded with tropical and citrus hops character and has that classic hazy, golden color. And just like the city where it's brewed, this unapologetic IPA is left unfiltered.</p><br/>

          <p class="subtitle">Lager 5.0% ABV</p>
          <p class="subsubtitle">25 years after opening our first garage brewery in Manayunk, we've built our dream brewery in the heart of the city, all thanks to our fans who have been loyal since the beginning. As a sign of our gratitude, we've used our new world-class brewing system to create Loyal Lager: a crisp, easy-drinking American Craft Lager brewed with two-row malt and aromatic Loral hops. It's what a clean, high-quality lager is meant to be.</p><br/>

          <p class="title">Philadelphia Pale Ale</p>
          <p class="subtitle">Pale Ale 4.6% ABV</p>
          <p class="subsubtitle">Not to be boastful, but we believe that all other ales pale in comparison to this Philadelphia favorite. Dry-hopped with an abundance of distinctive Simcoe hops, this straw-colored pale ale is more drinkable than bitter, more aromatic than aggressive. Now in cans, it�s great for poolside. And look for the new 19.2oz cans at the ballpark.</p><br/>

          <p class="subsubtitle">Crafted in the style of an English mild, this malt-forward ale is great when you want to go a few rounds, its smooth character, hints of caramel and toast and remarkable drinkability define this ruby-colored brew as a knockout session ale.</p><br/>

          <p class="subsubtitle">Our Signature IPA is loaded through and through with assertive American hops. Traditional floor-malted English barley gives IPA its firm malt character while generous amounts of Chinook and Amarillo hops impart aromas of pine and tangerine for a perfectly balanced IPA.</p><br/>

Luscious notes of coffee and chocolate accent Love Stout`s smooth, creamy mouth feel. We will not apologize for any amorous affairs resulting from the consumption of this beverage!</p><br/>

          <p class="subsubtitle">The people have spoken. We are pleased to announce that PYNK is now available all year-round! Each sip of PYNK starts with a crisp, fruity zing and finishes refreshingly dry. The delightful pink hue comes from heaps of fresh raspberries and cherries in every batch. It's no wonder PYNK is called the rose of beer. So let's raise our bottles and pints to the good things in life, like family, friends, and beer, that bring us all together.</p><br/>

          <p class="subsubtitle">Our first-ever and most-beloved brew, ESA helped establish a following for cask-conditioned beer in the United States back in the �90s. East Kent Golding hops give this British-inspired ale a subtle spiciness, which complements the strong malt backbone. ESA is floral, earthy and smooth with hints of chocolate and caramel, rounding out this deep chestnut-colored ale.</p><br/>
