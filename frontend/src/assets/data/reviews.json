Smell- Citrus (Mostly orange), mango and papaya, herbal/floral hops.Taste- Similar to the aroma, juicy orange and tropical fruit with a lightly bitter hop back end.Feel- Medium bodied, fairly crisp and dry. Active carbonation on the tongue.",

        "review": "A - Pours the classic thick dark black with an oily shine. The head is Beige and retains very well.S - Oh yes ! Heaps of sweet vanilla with a slight roasted background.T - Well if you like Vanilla, coconut milky stouts then this is for you. The finish is toffee and caramel. Very little roast or molasses. M- This is very full body and low carbonation. It is very viscous indeed. O - Well this is a Monster stout. And for those of you who like the Vanilla in your stouts then this will do you very nicely",
