            "description": "Brewery ARS is a small garage brewery in South Philadelphia and the brainchild of Andy and Sean Arsenault, who began their brewing career as engineers with curiosity. After spending Friday evenings at the Foodery at 10th and Pine with a 6 pack of Yuengling and one craft beer from around the world each week, the brothers realized that they both were fond of the Belgian styles and grew an affinity for yeast-forward beers. After years of planning and tinkering recipes, the brewery officially opened its doors on December 17, 2016. Since then, the duo have brewed over 70 different batches of 56 different beers, including collaborations with Highway Manor Brewing and Kurant Ciders, exploring the endless flavor profiles craft beer has to offer.",

As we got to know Philly, we fell in love with its rich brewing history. We were amazed by the number of breweries that existed here (nearly 700 before Prohibition was enacted). Each neighborhood had a brewery that served the local residents, and beer was a part of every table. We want to make that a reality for our neighbors today. We think you should know your brewer and be able to watch your beer being made.WE THINK BEER SHOULD STILL BE AT THE CENTER OF EVERY TABLE.",
